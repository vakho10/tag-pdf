# Tag a PDF

## Overview
This is an example project which uses JasperReports library to generate tagged PDF document with custom tag values for future machine reading.

## How It Works
Basically, the custom tags are attached to passed-in parameters for JasperReports's template. If you want to tag something else then you'll have to change the implementation to suit your needs.
